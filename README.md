# Monte-Carlo Simulations in Rust

Inspired by the article [The art of solving problems with Monte Carlo simulations](https://ggcarvalho.dev/posts/montecarlo/),
this repository contains the Monte-Carlo simulations re-written in Rust.

## Implemented Simulations

- [Estimating Pi](/src/pi.rs)
- [Estimating the Euler number](/src/euler.rs)
- [Example calculation for the birthday paradox](/src/birthday.rs)

## Running the code

In the root folder run
```bash
cargo run
```
